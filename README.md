Leap Reddit 3D

A reddit browser using Three.js CSS3D Renderer

To use, make sure that all the neccesary files are included,
And that you have a LEAP device.

To switch which subreddits you are viewing, look at the global
variable: subreddit.

Be cautious though, because if there are not enough i.imgur.com 
links in the subreddits you choose, then not enough images will
be loaded, and the program will break.



ROADMAP (please join me in making this better):

  - add parsing functions for urls other then i.imgur.com
  - create different ways of organizing the data (by score, date, etc)
  - create different 'arrangements' of the data ( random )
  - add ability to switch between subreddits mid app
  - create a interesting new interface to switch between subreddits
